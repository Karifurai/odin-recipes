    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pieces white fish</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sweet paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon (sliced)</li>
        <li>Minced parsley (to serve)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Dry the fish well with paper towels then sprinkle the lemon pepper, 
            <br>
            garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and paprika evenly over both sides of the fish.</li>

        <li>Drizzle half of the olive oil over one side of the fish pieces then pat the spices onto the fish so that they 
            <br>
            really stick to the fish. Transfer the fish to a baking sheet, oiled side down. Drizzle the remaining olive 
            <br>
            oil over the fish and once more pat the spices onto the fish. Arrange a few lemon slices around the fish.</li>

        <li>Bake the lemon pepper fish for 12-15 minutes, or until it turns white and flakes easily. Serve the fish 
            <br>
            with the lemon slices on the side and a little parsley sprinkled over the top.</li>
    </ol>
